'''
A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.

Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.

Write a function:

def solution(X, Y, D)

that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.

For example, given:

  X = 10
  Y = 85
  D = 30
the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:

after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
X â‰¤ Y.

def solution(X, Y, D):
    count = 0
    while X < Y:
        X += D
        count += 1
    return count

# there is a way to imporve this even further. You can simple use division and modulus to get the answer.

# You can just divide the distance between X and Y by D to get the number of jumps needed. Then if you have a remainder add one last jump to get to the final position.

def solution(X, Y, D):
    quotient, remainder = divmod(Y - X, D)
    return quotient + 1 if remainder != 0 else quotient
